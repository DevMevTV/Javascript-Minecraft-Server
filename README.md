# Very WIP Typescript Minecraft Server Software

If you encounter any issues, like not being able to see the motd and stuff, or if you encounter a unexpected packet, report them [here](https://github.com/DevMevTV/Typescript-Minecraft-Server/issues)

Please note that this is a WIP project, and not being always worked on. Im trying to make the code as readable as possible, tho with Minecrafts Protocol, that can be very tricky.
